        about : `
        Braincize was established to develop and offer advanced diagnostic imaging solutions using Artificial Intelligence (AI) along with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) methods, to help Predict the degree of Brain volume loss and Atrophy (Shrinkage). AI is especially helpful in predicting regional and global atrophy in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI), and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) due to blast-related injuries during conflicts in the middle east as well as due to concussive and sub-concussive sport-related injuries in athletes who have suffered repeated injuries as well. We utilize a combination of the Neurosciences along with data driven science and Machine Learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict and establish regional and global brain volume loss resulting from such injuries as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzhiemer disease, Parkinson Disease, Frontal Lobe Dementia and other dementia syndromes which demonstrate brain atrophy as part of such syndromes. It is important to diagnose and establish early brain atrophy in the above patients which may lead to possible early medical intervention.

        It takes the whole management process that produces tons of paper & time waste and puts it into the palm of your hand.
        Users are able to register their stores and then use the features such as:
        - inventory management
        - sales
        - reorders
        ...
        and many more.
        The highlight being that they don't need to spend hours after closing time inside their store.
        They can do all of that from the couch at home while spending time with their family.`
