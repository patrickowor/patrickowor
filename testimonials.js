        a self starter at heart who's satisfaction is derived by solving problems the easiest way possible.
        We have met online on Fiver, whilst he was finishing up his studies. 
        
        His personal contribution ,as a minority co-owner to our business, drives the growth of the company substantially. 
        
        This is due to his exceptional team leadership skill and conceptional thinking ability.
        His creativeness and outgoing nature doesn't stop on the console but translates also into music. 
        
        I am grateful to be growing the business with Patrick and am looking forward to be sharing further +20years of growth !`,
